/*
 =================================Target Queue======================
 
 A custom dispatch queue doesnâ€™t execute any work, it just passes work to the target queue. By default, target queue of custom dispatch queue is a default-priority global queue. Since Swift 3, once a dispatch queue is activated, it cannot be mutated anymore
 
 The target queue of a custom queue can be set by the setTarget(queue:) function. Setting a target on an activated queue will compile but then throw an error in runtime. Fortunately, DispatchQueue initializer accepts other arguments. If for whatever reason, you still need to set the target on an already created queue, you can do that by using the initiallyInactive attribute available since iOS 10.

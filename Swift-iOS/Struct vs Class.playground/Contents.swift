 /*=========================
 Common in Class vs Struct:
  ===========================*/
 
 /*
  1. Can have property and stored values
  2. Can define init()
  3. Can use subscript
  4. can be extended with extension
  5. can confirm to protocol
  */

 /*==========================
  Extra features in class
  ===========================*/
/*
  1. Support inheritence
  2. Have deinitializer
  3. Class are ref type while struct value type
  */
 
 
 /*========================
  When to use struct?
  ==============*/
 
 /*
  1. Can use in multithreading to avoid race condition. since copy of struct will be passed. To use class we need to maie class threadsafe first
  2. Struct is fast in memory since store in stack while class in heap which is too slow operation then stack
  3. Can use struct for data object that are passed arround classes

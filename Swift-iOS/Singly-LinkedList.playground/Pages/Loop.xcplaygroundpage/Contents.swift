/**
 Approach: This is the fastest method and has been described below:

 Traverse linked list using two pointers.
 Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
 If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.
 */

/**
 Another is User set and store ref for nodes
 */

/**
 Another maintain flag property for each node, keep marking flag to 1 when visit, see if got 1 again
 */
